# nodejs-clustered-matchmaking
This is going to be a clustered game server able to use multiple locations.S
imilar to how rocket league works, the player will connect to a master server and then request a game to join.
The main server will initiate a game if enough people are looking for one and match them against each other.

## Why
* I have never written a node.js module before!
* I could not find a node.js module to handle this type of situation.
